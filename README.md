# YFX Contract V4 Core

YFX is a decentralized perpetual exchange with up to 100x leverage, high liquidity, low fees, and no transaction slippage.
YFX adopts the PvPool (PvP) trading mechanism, allowing traders and liquidity pools to trade directly. Liquidity providers can add or remove liquidity for linear, inverse, and quanto contracts to or from single-asset pools with no impermanent loss. Liquidity providers can earn transaction fees and profit from selling LP tokens at a higher price.
